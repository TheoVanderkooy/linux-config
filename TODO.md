#TODO

- look into gpg-agent (replace ssh-agent?)
- some alternative to ssh-agent that is easier to automate and better automated
- make setup.sh to setup stuff after cloning repo
- add git config?
- use same config file for vim/nvim
- git config: core.excludesfile = ~/.gitignore_global
- .bashrc: refactor: put the GIT_PS1_* variable exports somewhere better
