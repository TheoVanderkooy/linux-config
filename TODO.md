#TODO

- look into gpg-agent (replace ssh-agent?)
- some alternative to ssh-agent that is easier to automate and better automated
- make setup.sh to setup stuff after cloning repo
- .bashrc: refactor: put the GIT_PS1_* variable exports somewhere better
- do something with bashrc_added_stuff.sh
- nixos configuration!
  - [x] move/copy stuff to nix home manager if possible
  - [ ] make flakes?
- restructure to put stuff in XDG standard  directories
  - note: some stuff like tmux only supports it in newer versions.
  - Git: .config/git/config instead of .gitconfig!
